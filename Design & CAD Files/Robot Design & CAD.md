# Robot Design & CAD
The robot design has been defined analytically, considering the real applications for which was developed. 

Kinematics:

Joint 0: fixed. Link 0 (base link): the base link does not add any limitation for the robot movement, but contributes to the vertical range.

Joint 1: revolute. Link 1: contributes to the range and allows the movement normal and away from the base z axis.

Joint 2: revolute. Link 2: Allows the movement towards the base for which as large as the link 1 would be optimal.

Joint 3: revolute. Link 3: The link rotates holding link 4 and limiting its motion.

Joint 4: primatic. Link 4: allows and sets the maximun range at the vertical direction.
